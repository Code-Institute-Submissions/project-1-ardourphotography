# Ardour Photography - Website for a Photography Firm  
##  Code Institute - User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project (1)
##  Student Name: Denise Lee Chew Woon

For this project, a website was created for a fictitious photography company.

<a href="https://ibb.co/8dd0fDr"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/CMMzY5b/Project-Pages.jpg" alt="Project-Pages" border="0"/></a>

This website aims to showcase the company's best photography work and eventually achieve  a call to action from the user. From the company name, logo, corporate colour scheme to the website design concept, the objective is to provide a forthright, passionate yet sincere approach to attract the target audience. 

After visiting the website, the user should be able to fully understand the company's background and basic team structure via the introduction on the About Us page. The best photography works of the firm will also be interactively illustrated on the Galleries page. Eventually, with hopes to establish a connection with the customers at the Contact Us page.
 
## UX

The target audience for the website will be
* Consumers looking for professinal photographers
* Photography enthusiasists

In order to achieve the intent of converting viewers of the website into company customers or potential photography collaborations, the wesbite aims to portray a forthright, passionate yet sincere image for the company. It uses clean, minimalist yet attention seeking elements to capture and leave a impression on the viewers. A four-colour palette scheme consisting of both warm and cool colours was maintained throughout the whole website design. The website strives to represent a certain degree of professionalism by keeping the minimalist look and feel through the whole website. This is consistent and evdident through the initial sketching of the wireframe. A copy of the sketch may be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1v517SFDDMVm5ZJ5zaNFKmwJi8O_Qc_-k).

Besides the look, the website also ensure that it is user-friendly and intereactive. When a user first enter the website, they will be greeted by a captivating photo and the company logo and quote followed by a button. This will induce the user to look at the company name, quote and photo before they officially enter to the About Us page.

By bringing the users directly to the About Us page, it guides them immediately to find out about what the company is doing. In there, users will be "greeted" by the team as they hover over their photos. On hovering each profile photo, it shows : I'm Name (Joseph) followed by their designation. Using this, I hope to create a light-hearted and welcoming ambience to the page. 

Naturally, the core of the website is the galleries page since this is a photography company website. To ensure that users can view their desired categories of photography works , the various galleries were carefully categorized using prominent images. Upon entering each gallery, users will be able to view the photographs clearly via the modal image gallery (lightbox). Needless to say, the photographs will do the talking/selling!

Last but not least, I hope to finally established a contact with the user of the website. To keep the users, I hope to keep it simple by establishing a clear and painless contact form for them to fill in. The email and message segment was made a required field so the company will be able to follow up with them on their wishes or requests.

### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
